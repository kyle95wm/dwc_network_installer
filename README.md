## TODO

Incorperate CentOS systems at some point.....

Want to set up your own DWC network server without doing all kinds of command line work?

If the answer is yes, you've come to the right place!

# What these scripts do

These scripts run a series of commands to assist you in installing and uninstalling your server, and many other things.


# PLEASE NOTE

You MUST be running an opperating system that supports APT-GET as a package manager. For example, Raspbian (the native Debian for Raspberry Pi_ and Ubuntu support APT right out of the box


# If you are having problems or have recommendations on improving either one of these scripts, let me know in the issues section

# TIP

You can skip the auto-update process by using the -s switch

for example

    sudo ./install.sh -s
